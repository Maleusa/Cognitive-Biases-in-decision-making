# Cognitive Biases in decision making

This is a proof of concept for implementing biases in the decision making of agents in the SWITCH simulation (https://github.com/ANR-Switch/SwITCh-v2) written in python. 
To use this simply clone it and run main for simulating single agents, or mainRand to generate a large number of random agents in a fixed environnement, follow the instructions in the terminal to get results
